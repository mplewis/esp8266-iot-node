# ESP8266 IoT Node

A project template for NodeMCU (ESP8266) projects using the Arduino framework.

# Goal

Build a node that is discoverable via UDP that supports basic HTTP requests.

Hopefully, hook this up to [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) to build some awesome $4 HomeKit nodes.

WIP.
